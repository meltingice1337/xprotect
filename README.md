Protect your files easy &amp; secure
### What is this ?

**XProtect** protects your files easy & secure and with a beautiful GUI. Not only you can encrypt/decrypt files, you can create an executable that will contain all your files. You can take this executable everywhere and extract your files **on the spot**, without needing any extra software. You can press 'Add Files' or use drag and drop to add files. You can press 'Remove Files' or delete in order to remove the selected files in the list. As encryption algorithm it uses AES-256.

There are 2 methods of encryption:

1. **The normal method** -  You can encrypt/decrypt files with the given password. This method has 2 options:
  1. 'One file' option. If you choose this option all of the selected files will be encrypted and saved in one file. When decrypting the files will be extracted with their original name.
  2. 'Each file' option. If you choose this option each file will be encrypted and saved separately. When decrypting you have the option to keep the file's original name.
2. **The portable method** - Your files will be encrypted and saved as an executable. You can take this executable anywhere and extract your files on the spot.
